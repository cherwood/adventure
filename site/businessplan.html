          <h2>
          	The project
          </h2>
          
          <h3>
          	What is it all about ?
          </h3>
          
          <p>
          	It's about giving people a tool to help them by tedious tasks a little bit more fun. (and maybe, MAYBE addictive)
          </p>
          
          <h3>
          	Why this project ?
          </h3>
          
          <p>
          	We find that incorporating new habits into your lifestyle can be quite hard, and we're convinced we're not the only ones ! 
          	So we thought we could build a tool that we would ourselves use, and that others could too.
          </p>
          
          <h3>
          	Which phase are you in ?
          </h3>
          
          <p>
          	We have the concept, and the main assets of the app. 
          	We have yet to test it for a longer period of time to debug it completely, and optimize it for all devices.
          </p>
          
          <h3>
          	Who ?
          </h3>
          
          <p>
          	Our main audience would be primarily teenagers and young adults, but everyone is concerned, really.
          	We thought the concept could incitate them to make changes into their lives little by little by giving them an app easy and fun to use.
          </p>
          
          <h3>
          	The future
          </h3>
          
          <p>
          	In the future, we think about developing native apps to take this idea to its maximum potential; make it smoother and using push notifications to remind the user not to forget its daily activities.
          
          	Depending of the reaction of the public, we could add some extra bonuses and make a one-time pay for them to enjoy more content, and on our side to be able to develop the app full-time.
          </p>
          
          <p>
          	Who knows. We could add more RPG-like elements like a map, battles and weapons to make it more like a real game. Dragons, quests, NPJ.. The sky's the limit.
          </p>
